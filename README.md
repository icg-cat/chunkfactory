The package `chunkfactory`is meant to minimize the coding for markdown documents where a handful of functions need to be executed iteratively. This could facilitate, for instance, the production of documents for the exploration of bivariate descriptive statistics. 

It solves 2 problems: 

* repetitive code when performing the same operations on multiple combinations of variables
* presenting figures and tables in RMD when repeating functions on a list

The chunk factory can be applied to custom functions, or can be used with the built-in descriptive statistics functions for weighted data. Let's see the two cases.
